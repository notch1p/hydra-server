## Setup Instructions

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/dmilin1/hydra-server.git
cd hydra-server
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

Install backend dependencies:

```bash
bun install
```

Install frontend dependencies:

```bash
cd frontend
bun install
cd ..
```

### 3. Environment Configuration

Create a `.env` file in the root directory with the following variables (or copy the .env.example file):

```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
# You can generate an encryption key with this command `openssl enc -aes-256-cbc -k secret -P -md sha256`
ENCRYPTION_KEY=your_32_character_encryption_key_here
DASHBOARD_PASSWORD=your_secure_dashboard_password

IS_CUSTOM_SERVER=true
```

**Important Notes:**

- `ENCRYPTION_KEY` must be exactly 32 characters long
- `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` should be changed for security purposes
- `IS_CUSTOM_SERVER=true` is required to bypass subscription checks

### 5. Build the Frontend

Build the React dashboard:

```bash
cd frontend
bun run build
cd ..
```

The built files will be served automatically by the backend server.

### 6. Running the Server

```bash
bun run start
```

The server will start on `http://localhost:3000`

### 7. Accessing the Dashboard

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`. You'll be prompted to enter the dashboard password (the value of `DASHBOARD_PASSWORD` from your `.env` file).

### 8. Connecting to Hydra App

Navigate to Settings => Advanced => Use Custom Server. Enable it and enter the public IP or domain you're hosting the server on without a trailing slash. Hydra will automatically attempt to validate if the server is working. If hosted on a home computer, you will likely need to set up port forwarding and include port 3000 (or whatever external port you chose).
